I will keep all the files used to create my custom board here.

The exact parts I have bought are  
1 - Arduino Nano ATmega328P CH340 Microcontroller  
1 - [Gyroscope (MPU6050)](https://components101.com/sensors/mpu6050-module)  
1 - Ultrasonic Module EPLZON HC-SR04  
11 - GDW DS031MG 12g Servo Motor

Library for nano was copied from https://github.com/cyberlink1/Arduino-Eagle-Cad-Library
